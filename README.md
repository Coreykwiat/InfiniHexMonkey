**What is InfiniHexMonkey?**


Have you ever heard the saying "If you give a monkey a typewriter he will eventually write Shakespeare"?

Well this simple piece of software utilizes this concept to create ANY piece of software or file without the need to know how to code!!!!
Buttttt theres a catch...it may take forever and you may never create anything

If you give a monkey the ability to append hex randomly forever....he may be able to recreate Windows 11.
